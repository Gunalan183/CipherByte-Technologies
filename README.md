During my internship at CipherByte Technologies, I successfully completed several projects showcasing my frontend development skills:

WeatherVue: A dynamic web application displaying real-time weather information, designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Portfolio Website: A personalized portfolio showcasing my projects, skills, and experience, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for interactive elements.

To-Do List: An interactive task management application allowing users to add, edit, and delete tasks, implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a focus on user experience.

These projects highlight my proficiency in frontend technologies and my ability to create engaging and functional web applications.
